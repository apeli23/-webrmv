## Prerequisites

Entry-level knowledge in both javascript acnd react.

## Project setup

Use the command `npx create-next-app webcam_xter` to create a new Next.js project
You can head to the directory using `cd videomerge` when the project is ready.

We will begin with backend congiguration. The project backend will involve setting up a nextjs handler function that will upload our media files to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/?ap=em) website for online storage. The

You can start by using this [link](https://cloudinary.com/console) to log in  or create your own cloudinary account. In the website you will be provided a dashboard which will contain environment variables, your `cloudinary name`, `api key` and `api secret` necessary for the upload configuration. To include them in your project , create afile named `.env` in your root directory and paste inside the following

```
".env"

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME =

CLOUDINARY_API_KEY =

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

Replace the blacks above with values from your cloudinary project and restart your project using `npm-run-dev`.

Next move is to create a file named`upload.js` in the projects's `pages/api` directory.
In the `upload` file start by configuring the cloudinary environment keys which will prevent code duplictation.


```
var cloudinary = require("cloudinary").v2;

cloudinary.config({
    cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_NAME,
    api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
    api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});
```
We can then introduce a handler function which will handle our upload post request.

```
export default async function handler(req, res) {
    if (req.method === "POST") {
        let url = ""
        try {
            let fileStr = req.body.data;
            const uploadedResponse = await cloudinary.uploader.upload_large(
                fileStr,
                {
                    resource_type: "video",
                    chunk_size: 6000000,
                }
            );
            url = uploadedResponse.url
        } catch (error) {
            res.status(500).json({ error: "Something wrong" });
        }

        res.status(200).json({data: url});
    }
}
```

The function abovewill receive our frontend request body and upload it to cloudinary. It will then capture the uploaded media file's cloudinary url and send it back to front end as a response.

This concludes our backend. Let us now proceed to creating our application.
